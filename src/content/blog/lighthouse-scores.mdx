Green Lighthouse scores out of the box.

## Accessibility

Made with accessibility in mind. 

- Semantic html
- Skip to content button
- Descriptive aria-labels
- Descriptive image alt text
- Focusable html

## SEO

Control SEO values on a page-by-page, and site-wide basis. Inputs on individual pages are used for SEO values for the page, and if they're not set the site-wide values are used as a fallback.
