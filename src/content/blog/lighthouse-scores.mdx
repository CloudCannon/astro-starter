Green Lighthouse scores out of the box.

## Accessibility

Made with accessibility in mind.

* Semantic html
* Skip to content button
* Descriptive aria-labels
* Descriptive image alt text
* Focusable html

## Performance

Comes with image optimization, lazy and eager loading, minimal Javascript, all in a static Astro site, for low page bundle sizes and fast loading times.

## Best practices

Passes all the lighthouse recommended best practices.

## SEO

Control SEO values on a page-by-page, and site-wide basis. Inputs on individual pages are used for SEO values for the page, and if they're not set the site-wide values are used as a fallback. Comes with all the inputs you need to encourage editors to fill in the content that search engines expect for good SEO rankings. Performance, best practices and accessibility all play a part in this as well.
