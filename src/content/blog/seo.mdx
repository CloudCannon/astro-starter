Responsive images supported through [Astro Image](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#image--astroassets).
An Astro Image will process an image in your `src/assets` folder, and output an optimized image with a `srcset` and `sizes`.

This template also demonstrates [how to set](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/adjusting-the-uploads-path/) `uploads` paths on a per-input level, to allow for both processed and unprocessed images on one site. On this template, by default, image inputs are opened at `public/images`, meaning they are unprocessed images.

Components that use the Astro Image component are configured so the image source input opens at `src/assets/images`, which are images to be processed and optimized on build.
