Control SEO values on a page-by-page, and site-wide basis.

Inputs on individual pages are used for SEO values for the page, and if they're not set the site-wide values are used as a fallback.

Comes with all the inputs you need to encourage editors to fill in the content that search engines expect for good SEO rankings. Performance, best practices and accessibility all play a part in this as well.
