Use Tailwind to style your HTML, allowing you to style your components without leaving your HTML. This can be used in combination with normal CSS and SCSS styling, leaving you to add styles to your site however you want.

If you'd like to remove Tailwind:

1. Run the following command in the root of the site:

`npm uninstall tailwindcss @astrojs/tailwind`

2. Remove mentions of Tailwind from your `astro.config.mjs`

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import tailwind from '@astrojs/tailwind';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [tailwind()],
});
```

3. Delete your `tailwind.config.mjs` file.
