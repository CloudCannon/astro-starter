Blog section with tags and pagination included. Documentation, blog and other text heavy sections should replicate how the blog section is implemented in this template.

Blog pages in this template use MDX to allow for snippets. Snippets allow you to use HTML components throughout your markdown text.

A common layout, with changing markdown content is favored for these kinds of text heavy pages, rather than using Bookshop components - which are defined and managed in your markdown pages frontmatter. These text heavy pages will be edited in CloudCannon's content editor, rather than the visual editor used for building pages with Bookshop components.
