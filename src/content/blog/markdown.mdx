## Styling

The markdown toolbar has most of the options allowed enabled in the rich text editor, along with the necessary styling required by those elements. See the CloudCannon [Docs](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/configure-your-rich-text-editors/) for more information about configuring the markdown that editors can add to pages.

## Snippets

A Snippet is a predefined component that complements your Markdown content. Snippets are great for building an interactive page editing experience without touching the underlying code.

The name “Snippet” comes from “a snippet of source code” in your rich text content. However, Snippets in CloudCannon are not limited to just code. Snippets can accomplish many jobs. One might be a wrapper to contain shortcodes or templating language, while another might be a markup heading.

Snippets excel at providing a way to:

* Represent and create any HTML or Markdown structures in your rich text editor that you cannot add using the WYSIWYG toolbar.
* Edit the value of any HTML parameters in a component using a GUI (rather than directly interfacing with the code).
