We'll make some big ol' huge mountains! There's too many complicated things in our life already. All you're worried about is this nice outside shape. Always follow the angles. Don't just cover it all up -- leave these spots!

## At times we need more headings

Everybody should have a friend. Just sorta make these things up in your mind, and let them drop in. Help them make a happy buck or two. Sort of an orangy-yellowish color. Water breaks, and it churns, and it has fun!

Today's such a wonderful day, let's just make a happy little painting. Maybe I'll have a bit mountain today. You can do anything that you believe you can do. Get it to where you want it, and leave it alone. That's the fun part of this whole technique.

## This is one of those times

Don't over do it -- be careful. Be careful. Always start with a clean brush in a light area and work outward. We planned this son-of-a-gun right from the beginning. People are so excited when they see this happen. Everybody will see nature through different eyes.

### Subheading

Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Be sure it's odorless or you'll be working by yourself. A half a hair and some air. Let's build us a little cloud. I lived in Alaska for many, many years.

### Another subheading

Begin laying in just some beautiful little highlights. We'll just sort of see what happens. The round brush is so fun, let's go back to that. Just make little X's, and we'll put in a happy little sky. Always keep the brush moving.
